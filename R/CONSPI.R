#' Empirical data for Generic Conspiracist Beliefs (CONSPI) Scale (1,215 examinees, 64 variables). This scale was originally proposed by Brotherton et al. (2013). Data was available at Drinkwater et al. (2020) - https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.10008092. The scale contains 15 items, ordered 5-point categories. Five dimensions: Government conspiratorial practices (items 1, 6 and 11), Global (items 2, 7 and 12), Alien cover-up (items 3, 8 and 13), on welfare (items 4, 9 and 14) and Information control (items 5, 10 and 15).
#' It includes two samples, one comprising university staff, students and other workers (business, leisure and vocational/sports classes) (Sample == 1) and the other recruited through Critical Mix (Sample == 2) to be representative of the UK population.
